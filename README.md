# Food Emissions API

## Objectives
* Build an example API to show what information is needed for a mobile app for high school students to collect and analyze data about greenhouse gas emissions from their personal diets.
* Learn how to build, document, and consume an API using C#, APS.NET

## Purpose
* Through experience teaching AP Environmental Science, I observed that students struggled with projects that asked them to record details of their daily food consumed and then use online resources to analyze the greenhouse gas emissions. Often the initial excitement of the project was diminished when students struggled to find sufficient data to correctly model their complete diet. Though there are several apps and websites with information, compiling data from multiple sources was difficult due to different units and measurements that were not always easy to convert.  For some students this provided an interesting challenge, but for others it created a roadblock that limited access to the project and their learning.  The purpose of this project is to use an existing database of greenhouse gas emissions from food that is currently a bit too detailed and complicated for all high school students to access and utilize, and serve it as an API for a mobile app that is designed with teenagers as the users. The mobile app (will also be a web version to increase access via ubiquitous chromebooks in schools) will allow students to enter servings (more familiar than kilograms) of the food they eat to generate data of their greenhouse gas emissions.  The goal would be that they can use the app for basic analysis, but also generate data that could be used in a google sheet for further analysis and also to create multiple scenarios to test different hypotheses about the relative changes in greenhouse gas emissions caused by various changes to their diets (e.g. removing dairy versus changing all beef to chicken)
